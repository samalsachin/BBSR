# BHUBANESWAR MAP

This is a simple Java program that will take information (name) of the source vertex and the destination vertex, of Bhubaneswar, from the user and display the fare and shortest distance to reach the destination. 

The idea is implemented using Graph and Heap data structures.
The graph has nodes and edges. Nodes represent a vertex that will be containing certain information regarding that vertex like its name, and the edges which it connects. Edges (the connection between two nodes) represent the distance between the two nodes and the cost of each edge will be equal to the distance between the two of its connecting nodes. 

By using different algorithms like Dijkstra, breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc, the shortest path between the source station and the destination station is determined, and accordingly, the fare is being calculated on the basis of the total distance between the two nodes. 

Main.java cointains all the major code and Heap.java contains heap implementation.
